# Kronvel
Kronvel (Or KronvelLevels) is a modern EXP + leveling plugin for PocketMine servers. It listens to everyday gameplay (block breaking, mob kills), applies rank-based multipliers, stores player progress in SQLite, and keeps every user-facing string inside a language file for fast iteration.
